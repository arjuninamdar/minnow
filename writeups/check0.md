My name: Arjun Inamdar

My SUNet ID: arjun05 

I collaborated with: ganeshve, flt

I would like to credit/thank these classmates for their help: Ganesh Venu (ganeshve) 

This lab took me about 5 hours to do. I did attend the lab session.

My secret code from section 2.1 was: 916094 

I was surprised by or edified to learn that: Sockets and connections are handled through file descriptors. I had prior knowledge of how file descriptors worked (from CS111), but didn't fully realize that Unix systems used this abstraction for sockets and network handling. This is an elegant approach to unifying the computer's various responsibilities. This checkpoint taught me that reading/writing information to/from a socket is as simple as reading/writing to the file descriptor: this unifies and clearly deliniates user and kernel responsibilities.  

Describe ByteStream implementation. [Describe data structures and
approach taken. Describe alternative designs considered or tested.
Describe benefits and weaknesses of your design compared with
alternatives -- perhaps in terms of simplicity/complexity, risk of
bugs, asymptotic performance, empirical performance, required
implementation time and difficulty, and other factors. Include any
measurements if applicable.]
